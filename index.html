							<h2>Hi, I am Rophence!<br /></h2>
						</header>
						<p>I pursued a Master of Science in Biostatistics at Brown University School 
						    of Public Health in Providence, Rhode Island, United States. 
							I was a Graduate Research Fellow in the  Brown Moi Partnership for 
							Biostatistics Training in HIV (NAMBARI), a research training program 
							co-led by Principal Investigators Joseph Hogan, ScD and Ann Mwangi, PhD 
							that aims to build biostatistics capacity for HIV research at Moi University. 
					   </p>

					   <p>
						   Prior to joining Brown, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Applied Statistics 
						   with Computing degree at <a href="http://mu.ac.ke/">Moi University</a>, 
						   Eldoret, Kenya and graduated with a First Class Honors. My research interests revolve around harnessing the power of 
						   machine learning algorithms to analyze complex HIV-related datasets, 
						   identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights. By employing advanced
						   statistical models and data-driven approaches, I aim to improve our 
						   understanding of HIV transmission dynamics, disease progression, and 
						   treatment outcomes. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development 
						   of more effective strategies for HIV prevention, diagnosis, and therapeutic
						   interventions through innovative and data-informed approaches in the realm
						   of clinical trials.
					   </p>

					   </p>
					       During my previous research project, I had the privilege of working with,
						   <a href="https://jonsteingrimsson.github.io/">Jon Steingrimsson</a>, 
						   who served as my thesis advisor. Our research endeavor aimed to extend 
						   the findings of a cluster randomized control trial for cardiovascular 
						   risk reduction. Specifically, I  focused on generalizing these findings
						   to a target population derived from electronic health records. 
						   By leveraging the baseline covariate information contained within 
						   these records, my objective was to explore the applicability and 
						   effectiveness of the interventions studied in the trial on a broader scale.
                       </p>
