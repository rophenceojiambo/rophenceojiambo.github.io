					<h2><strong>Current Projects</strong></h2>
					<ul>
						<li><h3>Master's Thesis</h3>
						<p> Title: Generalizing Cluster Randomized Control Trial Results to a Target Population.
						<p> Advisor: <a href="https://jonsteingrimsson.github.io/" >Jon Steingrimsson</a>
					</ul>

				    <h2><strong>Past Projects</strong></h2>
					<ul>
						<li><h2>Statistical Learning and Big Data Final project (PHP 2650)</h2>
						<p>The <a href="https://rophenceojiambo.github.io/Reinforcement-Learning/">final project</a> 
						   centered around learning about a topic outside the
						   scope of the class, with a particular emphasis on applying reinforcement 
						   learning techniques to the field of stock trading. Our primary objective was 
						   to develop effective trading strategies by implementing SARSA and Q-Learning 
						   algorithms using the R programming language, as well as the DQN (Deep Q-Network)
						   algorithm using Python. These algorithms were employed to analyze historical stock
						   data and create adaptable trading strategies that can learn from market dynamics, 
						   ultimately optimizing investment decisions. Through this exploration of reinforcement
						   learning, we sought to unlock the potential of machine learning in enhancing stock
						   trading performance.
						
						<li><h2>Practical Data Analysis Final Project (PHP2550)</h2>
						<p> During the Fall 2022 semester at Brown University's School of Public Health, 
							as part of the PHP 2550 Practical Data Analysis course, a final project was 
							undertaken on the topic of Statistical Machine Learning for Foodborne Disease 
							Source Attribution. The project involved utilizing Listeria monocytogene pathogen 
							data obtained from the NCBI Pathogen Detection Database. The objective was to 
							develop a robust and efficient predictive framework for identifying the food 
							source of a Listeria monocytogene strain and isolate.
                       <br>
					   <p>  Various statistical machine learning methods were employed for multiclass 
					        classification, including Random Forests, Naive Bayes Classification, and Bayesian 
					        Additive Regression Trees (BART). These methods enabled the prediction of the specific
					        food source associated with a Listeria monocytogene outbreak. 
					        The <a href="https://github.com/rophenceojiambo/foodborne_diseases/blob/main/Final%20Report/php2550_final_manuscript.pdf">project's final report</a>,
					        offers more comprehensive details on the outcomes and findings.
					   <br>
					   <p>  The hope is that the results of the implemented models will aid in predicting
					        the sources of foodborne outbreaks involving Listeria monocytogenes. A 
					        <a href="https://idiseases.shinyapps.io/foodborne_diseases/">Shiny App</a>,
					        was created to showcase the practical application 
					       of the model's predictions in identifying the food sources associated with such outbreaks.

                     <li><h2>Statistical Programming in R (PHP 2560)</h2>
						<p>For this project we were required to create a Shiny app in small groups based on 
						   a published paper. Our group's app focused on the research article titled 
						   <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2767513?resultClick=3">
						   Simulation of Pool Testing to Identify Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019 
						   Under Conditions of Limited Test Availability</a>.
						   
					   <br>
					   <p>The purpose of our Shiny app, titled <strong>"COVID-19 Pooled Testing"</strong> is to provide 
					      users with a platform to implement pooled testing strategies for individuals 
						  suspected of having COVID-19. The app simulates the process of running pooled tests
						  by generating a population of positive and negative cases. Users are able to sample
						  a random group of individuals from this population by specifying the desired sample 
						  size, as well as the sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity 
						  (true negative rate) levels for their chosen state or region.
					  <br>
					  <p>Based on the user's input, the app selects a sample from the population without 
					     replacement and performs pooled testing to determine whether the sample yields true 
						 negative or true positive results. The simulated model then provides the corresponding
						 outcome (positive or negative), which helps determine the number of tests required. 
						 The Shiny app can be accessed <a href= "https://rophenceojiambo.shinyapps.io/Covid_19_Simulation_Model/">here</a>.

				     <li><h2>Multiple Linear Regression, a Statistical Consulting Project, December 2019 </h2>
						<p> This undergraduate project was an investigation into the Malaria prevalence among children
						    under 15 Years in Kenya using Multiple Linear Regression Model. We carried out 
							a comprehensive review of literature, data acquisition, data preprocessing,
							exploratory analysis, fit multiple linear regression model to determine temporal
							trends in malaria prevalence in Kenya and performed future malaria prevalence 
							projections.

					<h2><strong>Interested Collaborators</strong></h2>
					<p>I am currently seeking collaborative opportunities with researchers and analysts who
					   share a similar interest. With my expertise in statistical programming using R, 
					   I possess a solid foundation in a wide range of statistical techniques, 
					   including regression analysis, survival analysis, longitudinal and multilevel data 
					   analysis, machine learning, dimension reduction, clustering, and neural networks. 
					   I am passionate about tackling complex problems and leveraging data-driven approaches
					   to derive meaningful insights.
                   <br>
				   <p>If you are interested in partnering on analysis and research work, please don't 
				   hesitate to reach out to me. Whether it's conducting statistical analyses, developing 
				   machine learning models, or exploring novel research questions, I am excited to collaborate 
				   and contribute to impactful projects.
